        <h2>Here's a time line of Albert Einstein's life:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><b>1879</b> - Albert Einstein was born in Ulm. He received his secondary education at a city Catholic school.</li>
        <li><b>1895</b> - Came to Zurich to enter the Polytechnic. Having received an “excellent” in mathematics, he failed in French and botany. On the advice of the director of the Polytechnic, he entered the cantonal school of Aarau.</li>
        <li><b>1896</b> - During his studies, he studied Maxwell's electromagnetic theory and became a student at the Polytechnic. Here he became friends with the mathematician M. Grossman.</li>
        <li><b>1901</b> - Einstein's first paper, “Consequences of the Theory of Capillarity,” was published. At this time, the future great scientist was in great need. Therefore, thanks to the “patronage” of M. Grossman, he was accepted into the staff of the Federal Bern Office for Patenting Inventions.</li>
        <li><b>1904</b> - Began to collaborate with the journal “Annals of Physics”. His responsibilities included providing annotations of recent texts on thermodynamics.</li>
        <li><b>1905</b> - Einstein's general theory of relativity was published.</li>
        <li><b>1907</b> - The quantum theory of heat capacity was published. In 1912, it was refined by P. Debye, M. Born and T. Carman.</li>
        <li><b>1909</b> - He received a professorship at the University of Zurich.</li>
        <li><b>1910</b> - On the initiative of W. Ostwald, Einstein was repeatedly nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics. The first nomination for the theory of relativity took place.</li>
        <li><b>1911</b> - Headed the Department of Physics at the German University in Prague.</li>
        <li><b>1912</b> - The great scientist returned to Zurich and began teaching at the same Polytechnic where he himself had once studied.</li>
        <li><b>1913</b> - On the recommendation of V.G. Nernst and his friend Planck, he headed the Berlin Physical Research Institute. He was also enrolled in the teaching staff of the University of Berlin.</li>
        <li><b>1921</b> - Einstein received a Nobel in physics for his “safe” theory of the photoelectric effect. At this time, the brilliant physicist was away. Therefore, the German Ambassador to Sweden R. Nadolny received the prize for him.</li>
        <li><b>1955</b> - Einstein was often and seriously ill. He passed away on April 18, 1955. The cause of death was an aortic aneurysm. Before his death, he asked his loved ones not to give him a lavish funeral and not to disclose the place of his burial.

            Only twelve closest friends accompanied the great scientist on his final journey. His body was cremated and his ashes scattered to the wind.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <p><i>"Albert Einstein never doubted that Newton was the greatest scientific genius of all time. He said “Nature was an open book to him. He stands before us strong, reliable and alone.” However, the general consensus was that in the early twentieth century, Einstein stood on the shoulders of Newton, and somehow proved him wrong..."</i></p>
